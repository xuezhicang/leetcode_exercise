# HashMap,HashSetï¼Œand HashTable

>Hash table based implementation of the Map interface. This implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits null values and the null key.

>This class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance). It makes no guarantees as to the iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.

>This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value.

## Type of HashTable


## Crearing a new HashTable


## Finding elements in the HashTable


## Adding new element to the HashTable



## Deleting new element form the HashTable
